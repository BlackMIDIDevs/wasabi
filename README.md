## Features

- Extremely fast and optimized rendering using Vulkan
- Easy to use and configurable
- Integrated MIDI synthesizer (XSynth), alongside with KDMAPI and MIDI device support
- Partial support for Zenith color palettes

## Installation

Wasabi is a portable application and does not require an installation.
Your system must support Vulkan.

### Option A *(recommended)*

You can download and run a pre-built binary of Wasabi from the [releases page.](https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/wasabi/releases)

### Option B *(advanced)*

You can build Wasabi yourself by following these steps:

- Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/wasabi.git` (or [download as a ZIP from GitHub](https://github.com/BlackMIDIDevs/wasabi/archive/refs/heads/master.zip))
- Make sure that the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) are both installed on your system
- Inside the project directory run the following command to build Wasabi: `cargo build --release`
    - Optionally you can add `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` to your environment before compiling to optimize XSynth for your specific CPU
- After the compilation is finished, you will find the binary under `./target/release`

## Usage

- Before you can play a MIDI, you need to add soundfonts to the synthesizer by going to `Menu -> Settings -> SoundFonts`
- To open a MIDI, click the folder icon on the top left, or press `Ctrl+O` on your keyboard
- To find out about other keyboard shortcuts, head to `Menu -> Shortcuts`
